                <p>My name is Issa Issa and this is my portfolio. I am a fun loving guy who likes t play video games, hang out with my friends, and recently learn how to play Dungoens and Dragons! I'm not the most up to date when it comes to recent social media events, but if you asked me to tell you the original 151 Pokemon, I'd be more than willing to show you every single one, and explain why my boy Gengar is the absolute best out of all of them!<br><br>I would say that my hobbies have sparked my interest in learning coding and progarming. I hope to show you an amazing and well made website, if I do say so myself!</p>
